# POWER-BI-DASHBOARD-SALES-DATA-ANALYSIS
In this project, i have created a interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard on sales data and find some insights from the data.
In order to building the dashboard the ETL process was done as per the requirements, Power query was used to clean and transform the data and Advanced DAX was used for creating the culculated measures and culculated column. 
Once done with the culculations, i have made visualizations and create report using Donut chart, Advanced Schattered Chart which help to easy understanding of the sales Data
